# Anime-Face-Generation

### About :
The primary goal of this project is to utilize a sophisticated deep learning technique called Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) in conjunction with Keras and Tensorflow within a Kaggle Notebook to generate anime faces. This project involves training two essential models: the generator and the discriminator. The discriminator's role is to classify images as either real or fake, while the generator's objective is to produce images that closely resemble real ones and successfully deceive the discriminator. Ultimately, the generator will generate diverse output images that closely resemble the training dataset while exhibiting subtle variations.
